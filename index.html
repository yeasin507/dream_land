                        <p>Ever since the US military chose it as the new standard-issue pistol, the Beretta 92FS became a classic. It’s not only a favorite of military and law enforcement pros, but it’s starred in many movies, television shows and video games.
        
                            In a northern Italian valley known for rich veins of iron ore, the Beretta Forge landed it’s first contract to make gun barrels. It was October 3, 1526, and Bartolomeo Beretta agreed to make 185 barrels for 296 ducats.
                            
                            Fast forward to the 1980s. The US military’s surplus of the M1911 pistol had dwindled. They had issued the .45 caliber single-action semi automatic pistol since before World War I.
                            
                            Because of the looming threat of war with the Soviet Union, the forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) needed to standardize munitions for logistical purposes. They chose 9mm for pistols and submachine guns.
                            
                            The time had come to replace the M1911 with a newer design.</p>
